<strong>AI Assistant using IBM Watson technology taking WHO recommendations about COVID-19 in order to facilitate access to the information which is the first layer of people protection.</strong>

The assistant is able to provide information about the virus, its symptoms, incubation period, risks, and global case statistics.
Using Watson Assistant Natural Language Processing, we're been able to provide a user-friendly approach utilizing multiple nodes of interactions prepared especially for this purpose.

Through the Webhooks feature and IBM Serverless Cloud Functions, the assistant is capable to get connected with a data API that it's feeding with the latest statistics about the virus evolution across the planet.

This is a humble and small contribution to anyone to use it as a baseline to spread reliable information in order to avoid contagion.
